The #CostOfInaction on immigration is having a real affect on local communities. Read these letters to the editor: 
"America is a place for everybody—that's what we're fighting for."  —President Obama
"It's time for ten-ten. It's time to give America a raise." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage to $10.10
"You can give America the shaft, or you can give it a raise." —President Obama to Congress on the upcoming vote to #RaiseTheWage
"Members of Congress have a fresh chance to show which side they are on." —President Obama on the upcoming vote to #RaiseTheWage
"It's like that movie Groundhog Day—except it's not funny." —President Obama on the attempts to dismantle Obamacare
FACT: The majority of minimum wage jobs are held by women. #RaiseTheWage
"Don't 'boo'—organize. That's what you need to do. They may not hear the boos, but they can read a petition." —President Obama #OFAction
"Republicans in Congress don't want to raise it at all." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage
"Nearly 3 in 4 Americans support raising the minimum wage."  —President Obama #RaiseTheWage
"Fair wages and higher profits are not mutually exclusive. They go hand in hand." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage
"Raising wages is not just a job for organizers, not just a job for elected officials—it's also a job for businesses." —President Obama
"I don't want my daughters getting paid less than someone else's sons for the same job." —President Obama #StandWithWomen
"The good news is more young people are earning college degrees than ever before." —President Obama
"In America, we do not believe in opportunity just for the few—we believe that everybody should have a chance at success." —President Obama
"We just went through the first month since 2003 where no U.S. soldier was killed in either Afghanistan or Iraq." —President Obama
"7.1 million Americans have now signed up for coverage ... That's enough to fill up the Big House 65 times." —President Obama to @UMich
"We're now seeing the manufacturing sector add jobs for the first time since the 1990s." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage
"Our economy is doing better, it's growing." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage
Upcoming election is Afghan-owned, Afghan-led. Proud moment for the will of the people & in the nation's history.

.@nytimes on #GOPbudget: "Does [GOP] really want to coalesce around a budget this destructive to [America's] future?" 
.@AARP: Paul Ryan’s #GOPbudget "fails to address the high costs of health care and instead shifts costs onto seniors and future retirees"
Ryan's #GOPbudget would cut 3 million jobs in FY 2016. That's akin to firing the entire workforce in his home state: 
Citizens United was one of the worst decisions in the history of the Court. Today's ruling further drowns the voices of working Americans.
Today's Supreme Court ruling gives even more power to the wealthiest few who are trying to buy our democracy, like the Koch Brothers.
RT @ChrisCoons: Senator Reid speaking on Senate steps a few minutes ago. American workers deserve a fair shot! 
We took an important bipartisan step forward to #renewUI. We’ll need Republican cooperation to get a final vote soon:
